                <h2>Why</h2>
                Flood suction products are being developed due to a critical need, innovation potential, and market opportunity. Flooding is a significant threat to homes, businesses, and infrastructure, causing financial and emotional impacts. A user-friendly flood suction solution can provide immediate relief and restore normalcy. Existing products often lack effectiveness or ease of use, creating a gap for advanced technology. Focusing on sustainability and eco-friendly materials can appeal to environmentally responsible consumers. The market demand for effective flood management tools is on the rise due to climate-related disasters. This product offers a chance to make a meaningful impact in communities, empowering individuals and organizations to better prepare for and respond to flooding.

                <h2>What</h2>
                The hydrodefense project is a global initiative aimed at reducing drainage pollution by using floating bins connected to a machine for grinding waste. These bins, designed to collect trash from canals or clogged drainage, are equipped with a pump to draw in pollutants like plastic and oil. The waste is then collected in a pipe and will be grind into pieces, returning water to the clogged drainage.

            <div class="box pop-up-text">
                <h2>How</h2>
                Hydrodefense devices are used to collect trash, floating plastic, and aquatic waste from water bodies, particularly during and after floods. These devices can be modified for flood control, focusing on water pollution and waste collection during and after floods. They are strategically placed in flood-prone areas, such as urban canals, drainage systems, and rivers, and are designed to catch plastic, floating rubbish, oil, and surface pollutants. The devices can be funded by municipalities and governments, enhancing flood resistance and reducing environmental impact.
